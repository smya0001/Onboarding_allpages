                    <h3> What is the purpose of this site? </h3>
                    <p> Australia has some of the world's highest levels of ultraviolet 
                        radiation. Victorian’s, especially children, already face the world’s 
                        highest UV exposure due to geographic location. 
                        
                    <p> Combined with the soaring popularity of outdoor activities, 
                        children are facing alarming risks from sun exposure. With the 
                        increase of skin cancer, there is a need to raise awareness to 
                        parents on how we might help parents to safeguard children 
                        against the sun’s harmful rays to prevent skin damage.</p>
                        
                    <p> The goal of this website is to provide these people with the 
                        self-assurance and tools they need to start and maintain sun 
                        protection routines. </p>

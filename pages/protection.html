        <h2>Sun Protection</h2>
        <p>Australia is known for its higher average UV index compared to many other regions, underscoring the importance of sun protection measures even at relatively lower UV thresholds, such as 6-7. The emphasis on protective clothing and sunscreen usage aligns closely with the heightened sun exposure typically experienced in Australia. Sun protection is essential to prevent skin damage and reduce the risk of skin cancer. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun can cause sunburn, premature aging, and skin cancer. Wearing protective clothing and using sunscreen helps to block harmful UV rays and keep your skin safe. Don't forget to reapply sunscreen every two hours, especially after swimming or sweating, and seek shade during peak sun hours to further protect your skin.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low (1-2):</strong> Sunburn is unlikely, but minimal protection like a hat and sunglasses might be beneficial, especially for sensitive individuals. Protective clothing is not typically necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Moderate (3-5):</strong> Sunburn is possible, especially for prolonged exposure. Seek shade during peak sun hours (10 AM to 4 PM). Broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen and protective clothing are highly recommended, especially for those with fair skin or a history of sunburn.</li>
                <li><strong>High (6-7):</strong> Sunburn is very likely for unprotected skin. Seek shade, wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses. Broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen is essential, and reapplication is crucial.</li>
                <li><strong>Very High (8-10):</strong> Extreme caution is required. Seek shade as much as possible, wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses. Broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen is absolutely necessary, and reapplication is critical every two hours, or more often if sweating or swimming.</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme (11+):</strong> Avoid prolonged sun exposure. If outdoors, wear maximum protection with clothing, hat, sunglasses, and broad-spectrum SPF 50+ sunscreen reapplied frequently.</li>

                <p><u><strong>Below are factors that should also be taken into account when applying sunscreen.</strong></u></p>
                <li><strong>Individual factors:</strong> Skin type (fairer skin requires more), skin sensitivity, and medical conditions all significantly impact how much sunscreen is necessary.</li>
                <li><strong>Activity level:</strong> Sweating and being in water wash off sunscreen, requiring more frequent application and potentially a higher quantity.</li>
                <li><strong>Application method:</strong> Applying sunscreen unevenly or missing areas can leave you vulnerable to sunburn, regardless of the amount used.</li>
                <li><strong>Sun exposure duration:</strong> Spending more time in the sun necessitates reapplication and potentially more sunscreen initially.</li>
